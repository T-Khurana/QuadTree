# QuadTree

## Description
* The application is an implementation of a **Quadtree** in C++ using a recursive approach. A quadtree is a data structure in which each node has exactly **four children**. Therefore, each node in the tree has four pointers, instead of two (left and right child) as in a Binary tree. 
* The goal of the application is to store information regarding cities, based on their latitudes and longitudes. The nodes also store information about the city such as the name of the city, population (p), cost of living (r) and average net salary (s). 
* The application contains quadtreetest.cpp which is the driver program that reads the commands from standard input and write the output to standard output. 

## How to run the program
* To test the program on your local system, clone/fork and clone the repo, and navigate to the folder in your command line. 
* Then, to compile the program, run `g++ -std=c++11 quadtreetest.cpp`
* To run the executable generated, run `./a.out`
* The program can also be run using the test files with the .in extension in the repo.
