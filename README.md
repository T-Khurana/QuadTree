# QuadTree

## Description
The application is an implementation of a Quadtree in C++. A quadtree is a data structure in which each node has exactly four children. Therefore, each node in the tree has four pointers, instead of two (left and right child) as in a Binary tree. 
The goal of the application is to store information regarding cities, based on their latitudes and longitudes.
